[in no partcular order].  If you have helped and your name is not here email me at

1) Richard.van.de.Laarschot@ict.nl

   Gave help porting the lib to MSVC particularly pointed out various warnings and errors.

2) Richard Heathfield

   Gave a lot of help concerning valid C portable code.  

3) Ajay K. Agrawal

   Helped port the library to MSVC and spotted a few bugs and errors.

4) Brian Gladman

   Wrote the AES and Serpent code used.  Found a bug in the hash code for certain types of inputs.

5) Svante Seleborg

   Submitted the "ampi.c" code as well as many suggestions on improving the readability of the source code.

6) Clay Culver

   Submitted a fix for "rsa.c" which cleaned up some code.  Submited some other fixes too.  :-)
   Clay has helped find bugs in various pieces of code including the registry functions, base64 routines 
   and the make process.  He is also now the primary author of the libtomcrypt reference manual and has plan
   at making a HTML version.

7) Jason Klapste

   Submitted fixes to the yarrow, hash, make process and test code as well as other subtle bug fixes.  The 
yarrow code can now default to any cipher/hash that is left after you remove them from a build.

8) Dobes Vandermeer <dobes@smartt.com>

   Submitted HMAC code that worked flawlessly out of the box... good job!  Also submitted a MD4 routine.
   Submitted some modified DES code that was merged into the code base [using the libtomcrypt API]

9) Wayne Scott (wscott@bitmover.com)
  
   Submitted base64 that complies with the RFC standards.  Submitted some ideas to improve the RSA key generation
   as well.
   
10) Sky Schulz (sky@ogn.com)

   Has submitted a set of ideas to improve the library and make it more attractive for professional users.
   
11) Mike Frysinger 

   Together with Clay came up with a more "unix friendly" makefile.  Mike Frysinger has been keeping copies of 
   the library for the Gentoo linux distribution.
