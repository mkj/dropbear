%%% '%' and '#' are comments !!!!!!!

% This file must be called '.ccmalloc' and is searched for in the
% current directory and in the home directory of the user. If it
% does not exist then the default values mentioned below are used.

% It is also the only available user manual yet ;-) So here is a reading
% hint. First have a look at the short one line descriptions of each option
% ...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% with 'file' the executable is specified [a.out]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% This should not be necessary for Linux and Solaris because the proc
% file system can be used to find argv[0].
%
% (the rest of this comment only applies to other OS)
%
% For other OS you should use this option unless the executable is
% in the current directory or its name is 'a.out'.
%
% If you do not specify this then ccmalloc tries to find an executable
% in the current directory that matches the running program starting
% with 'a.out'. For this process it must call 'nm' on each executable
% file in the directory which may be time consuming. With this option
% you can speed up this process.
%
% You can also specify absolute or relative path names. This is 
% necessary if you do not start your program from the current directory.
% But you can also simply link or name your program to 'a.out'.

%file FILE

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'log' specify the logfile [stderr]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% The default is to use stderr. The argument to 'log' is the name of
% the file you want to write to. It can also be 'stdout' or '-' which 
% sets stdout as logfile. If the logfile is stdout or stderr and is
% connected to a terminal then the output is slightly different.
%
% For big programs the logfile can be really big. To reduce the size
% you can use a small chain length (see 'chain-length' below). The other
% possibility is to use compressed logfiles. This can be done by
% specifying a logfile name with  a '.gz' (or a '.Z') suffix. This means
% that gnuzip (resp. compress) is used to compress the output.

%log FILE

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'logpid' specify the logfile
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Can be used alternatively to the 'log' command if you want to use
% ccmalloc for debugging parallel applications where several copies of
% the program you are debugging must be run simoultaneously. In this
% case you can not use 'log' because you do not want to write to the same
% log file. Using 'logpid' uses a file name ending with the <pid> of
% the process which means the name is unique even if several copies of
% your program are run simoultaneously.
%
% If you use the compressing suffixes then the <pid> is inserted before
% the suffix (e.g. 'logpid ccmalloc.log.gz' uses 'ccmalloc.log.<pid>.gz'
% as the name for the log file).

%logpid FILE

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'dont-log-chain' skip info about certain chains []
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% This command may be repeated any number of times. The argument to this
% command is a comma-separated list of function-or-file-and-line
% specifications. Garbage allocated from a callchain that contains this
% subchain anywhere will _not_ be logged.
%
% The ';'-separated list should not contain any spaces. E.g. not:
%
%    main ; foo ; bar
%
% but:
%
%     main;foo;bar
%
% A function-or-file-and-line specification is a string followed by an
% optional colon and number, for example: main or main:14 or main.c or
% main.c:15. Note that the string is compared with both the function and the
% file name, if available. If main.c happens to be a function name, that
% will cause a match (for that string at least).  Not specifying a line
% number will match any line number. If line number information is not
% available, anything will match!  Not specifying a name (e.g. ;;;) will
% match an unknown function name.  Not giving any parameters at all, will
% match a chain containing at least one unknown function.
%
% Note that if you say 'dont-log-chain wrapper.c' nothing will be logged.

%dont-log-chain

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'only-log-chain' skip info about other chains []
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% The obvious counterpart to dont-log-chain. In this case, only matching
% chains will be reported. Non-matching chains will not be reported.
% Can be repeated any number of times; if the chain matches any of the
% instances, it will be reported.

%only-log-chain

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% with 'only-count' ccmalloc only counts garbage - no call chains [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% If only-count is set to one then only one additional pointer for
% each allocated data is used and no call chain is generated. This is
% the fasted and most space efficient mode ccmalloc can operate
% in. In this mode you get at least the size of garbage produced.
%
% Note that 'check-free-space' does not work at all with 'only-count'
% set and over writes ('check-overwrites') are only checked when
% calling free.

%set only-count 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'load-dynlibs' load dynamic linked libraries into gdb [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% If your program is linked with dynamic libraries, function and file
% name information is not available for addresses in those libraries,
% unless you set 'load-dynlibs' to 1.

%set load-dynlibs 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'keep-deallocated-data' does not recycle deallocated data [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you enable keep-deallocated-data then all data deallocated with
% 'free' (or 'delete' in C++) is not given back to the free store
% but stays associated with the call chain of its allocation. This is
% very useful if your program does multiple deallocation of the
% same data.

%set keep-deallocated-data 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'check-overwrites' detect overwrites [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you want to detect 'off by n bytes' errors you should set
% 'checking-overwrites' to n/4 (on 32-Bit machines).
%
% ccmalloc inserts a boundary above allocated data. This boundary
% consists of 'check-overwrites' words. If your program writes to
% this area then ccmalloc can detect this (see also check-start
% and check-interval). 'ccmalloc' also does checking for overwrites
% at non word boundaries (e.g. strcpy(malloc(strlen("hello")),"hello");)

set check-overwrites 1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'check-underwrites' detect underwrites [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% same with writes below allocated data. You do not have to set this
% option if you only want detect 'off (below) by one' errors because
% ccmalloc keeps a magic value just before the user data.

set check-underwrites 1


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'check-free-space' can be used to find dangling pointers. [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% A very serious type of bug is to write on data that has already been
% freed. If this happens the free space management of malloc is in
% trouble and you will perhaps encounter non deterministic behaviour of
% your program. To test this first enable 'keep-deallocated-data' and
% restart your program. If the problem goes away and ccmalloc does not
% report anything then you should *also* enable 'check-free-space'. Now
% ccmalloc checks already deallocated data for corruption.
%
% Note that to perform this check 'keep-deallocated-data' also must
% be enabled and 'only-count' disabled.

set check-free-space 1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'check-interval' can be used to speed up checks [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% If check-overwrite, check-underwrites or check-free-space is set then
% the default is to do 'write checks' when data is deallocated and
% to do 'free space checks' when reporting together with
% 'write checks' for garbage. When you want these checks to be
% performed more often then you should set 'check-interval' to a
% positive number. This number is the interval between the number of
% calls to free or malloc without performing the checks.

%set check-interval 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'check-start' can be used to speed up checks [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% The flag 'check-start' delays the start of checks until the given
% number of calls to free and malloc have occured. Together with
% 'check-interval' you can use a binary search to find an aproximation
% when a corruption occured! If you simply set check-interval to 1 and
% check-start to 0 then this will slow done your program too much.

%set check-start 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'silent' disables banner [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you don't want to see the banner of ccmalloc then set
% 'silent' to 1 (f.e. when logging to stderr)

%set silent

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'file-info' en/disables file and line number information [1]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% If your program was compiled with debugging information (-g) then
% ccmalloc can generate line number and file info for call chains opening
% a pipe to gdb. For very big programs this method is slow. In this case
% you can set 'file-info' to zero and you will only get the function
% names. For SunOS 4.3.1 'nm' does not 'demangle' C++ identifiers
% very well. So gdb is called instead but only if 'file-info' is
% not set to 0.

%set file-info 1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'continue' if ccmalloc aborts when something weired happened [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% If the free function of ccmalloc is called with an argument that does
% not make sense to ccmalloc or that has already been freed then you
% probably want the program to stop at this point. This is also
% the default behaviour. But you can force ccmalloc also to ignore
% this if you set 'continue' to 1. This flag also controls the behaviour
% of ccmalloc when free space is found to be corrupted or a write
% boundary has been overwritten.

%set continue 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'chain-length' is the length of the maximal call chain [0 = infinite]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can restrict the length of call chains by setting 'chain-length'
% to a number greater than zero. If 'chain-length' is zero (the default)
% then chains are as long as possible (on a non x86 system only call
% chains with a finite maximal length can be generated). For big
% programs especially if keep-deallocated-data is enabled this can
% reduce the size of the log file from over 100MB to several MB!

%set chain-length 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'print-addresses' of data [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you want to see the addresses of the allocated data (and
% deallocated data if keep-deallocated-data is set to 1) set
% 'print-addresses' to 1.

%set print-addresses 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'print-on-one-line' shortens log file [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% The default is to print function names and file/line number info
% on separate lines. With 'print-on-one-line' set 1 all are printed
% on one line.

%set print-on-one-line 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'additional-line' enlarges readability [1]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% When printing call chains an empty line is printed between to
% call points. Set 'additional-line' to 0 to disable this feature.

%set additional-line 1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 'statistics' enables more accurate profiling [0] 
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Calculate number of allocations and deallocations and bytes also on
% a per call chain basis. This uses 4 additional pointers for each
% call chain.

set statistics 1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% set order for sorting of call chains [1] [1]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% When printing the report to the log file the call chains are sorted by
% default with respect to the largest accumulated garbage produced by
% that call chain. This can be changed with setting 'sort-by-wasted'
% to 0. In this case they are sorted by the number of allocated bytes.
% If you want the number of allocations (only possible if 'statistics'
% is enabled) as sorting criteria instead then set 'sort-by-size' to 0.

%set sort-by-wasted 1
%set sort-by-size 1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% report library chains [0]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Some external libraries (like libg++) have memory leaks. On some
% systems even a call to printf produces a leak. ccmalloc tries to
% detect this (only heuristically!) and with this flag you can control
% if leaks produced by such library calls are reported.
%
% Since version 0.2.1 some similar effect can be achieved by using
% 'dont-log-chain' with no argument.

%set library-chains 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% print debugging information [X] (compile time dependend)
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

%set debug X

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% align memory on 8 byte boundary [0] (no effect on SunOS or Solaris)
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

%set align-8-byte 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% only report allocations which ended up being wasted (i.e don't report
% allocations which were completely freed properly. ) [1]
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

%set only-wasting-alloc 1
